This is my AMAZING Lord of the Rings plugin. You can make new rings, add new abilities, or edit the existing ones.

for any help, feature requests, or bug reports my discord is CoreStone#4179.

use the comand /lotrgetring <ring name> to get the a ring.
use /lotrreload to reload LOTRings after editing the config.
